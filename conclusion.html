                <br/>
                Across all charts, the strongest factor influencing price is carat, with price rising as carat increases, 
                especially beyond the 2-carat mark. However, cut also plays a role: Premium and Very Good cuts tend to have higher price ranges 
                at similar carats, while Ideal cuts are more concentrated in smaller diamonds. Fair cuts show the most price variability, 
                possibly reflecting inconsistencies in quality or market value. These scatter plots confirm the finding from the 
                correlation matrix that carat is the most powerful predictor of diamond price, but also suggest that cut quality interacts 
                with carat to shape the final price.
